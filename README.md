- 👋 Hi, I’m Swati
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code various programs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science as sort of a side project alongside my regular academic work. I am planning to pursue Computer Science as one of my majors in the near future
- 💞️ Currently I am not as such looking for anyone to collaborate with but will be happy to in the future once I get the hang of things. 
- 📫 You can reach me through my Email : 20phoenix03@gmail.com
